                            Wallpaper

Picture in this directory is one of my favourite wallpapers. It's originaly from Deepin 
Os. If you have done .fonts directory first you can change your background by 
LXApearance if not, then just download feh. Feh is an CLI program and it was 
developed for changing backgrounds. Since I've allready setted up feh in .i3config all 
you have to do is copy the wallpaper.jpg to Picture folder.
