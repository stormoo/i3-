                                      Fonts
All you have to do is download all of the *.ttf files. Then just open terminal and type 
in these commands:

	mkdir ~/.fonts

Then type cd Downloads (or other name of your downloads directory) . If you do 
not have any other font files in your downloads file you can type in this command 

	first mkdir ~/.fonts

If you do have you have to copy those 4 files manualy.

Thats all. :-)

                                GTK 2.0/3.0 Fonts

You have changed font in your system. by i3config file. But you did not change your 
font in GTK applications yet. To do that, the easiest way is to install LX Appearance. 
Just install it with terminal, every distro got LX appearance in it's official repositories.
	
                                  LXAppearance

      After installation, open LX Appearance and a dialog will pop up. You can 
      change. Hovever there is a problem with this particular font (System San 
      francisco Display). It is not show in the dialog.

      To fix this just change yor font size and LX Appearance will automaticaly 
      generate .gtkrc-2.0 file in your home directory.You just open this file as root 	
      and change gtk-font-name to System San Francisco Display. That will change 	
      font in gtk 2.0 applications. But if your system uses gtk 3.0 as well ( and 90% 	
      it does ) , you have to edit your .config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini file in your home 	
      directory. So again, open it as root and change the gtk-font-name to System 	
      San Francisco Display.

Now you have succesfully change your font in systemandGTK 2.0/3.0 applications as 
well. After this change System San francisco Display finally appears in 
LXAppearance dialog.
