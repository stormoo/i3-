HelloWorld!

 Ths is my configuration of i3 window manager.

Firstly I want to say, that everyone should watch i3wm videos and i3wm userguide provided by i3wm team on official website.

My configuration is bassicly copy of config file from Alex Brooker(That guy who made series of i3 videos).
but I've channged few things. such as, config for rofi for 1366*768screen resolution.

If you wantto use my i3config,I recommend you to do some things first.
   Firstly, download fonts from .fonts directory.And install them. How todo that, just read provided readme file in .fonts directory.
   Then You would need to download 3rd party software. Speciallz rofi,compton and i3blocks.Most of distros got this softwarein their repos.
       Rofi is used instead of D-menu
       Compton enables opacity on windows
       i3 blocks is used for status on bar


Then when you have downloaded and installed all of this software you can use my config file.
  All you need to do is neplace the old config file with the new one.Afer that just log out/in.

    am using arc-darkertheme, so I recommend you to install this theme for color kohorence.
