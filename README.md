My configuration of i3 window manager

Firstly I recommend, or you should install fonts and i3blocks. After that you can copy the i3config file.


You also need to install aditional software like rofi and compton.
   ROFI is a supplement of D-menu. It looks nicer and easyier to customize but works basicly the same.
