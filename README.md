# i3-
HelloWorld!
Ths is my configuration of i3 window manager.

 Firstly I encourage you to watch this video https://youtu.be/j1I63wGcvU4 and also to read user guide on i3wm.org. User guideis bassicly describedin thefirstand second video,but is deffinitely worth reading it. At least you get to know al of the keyboard shortcuts and what is i3 really capable of.Those videos get me really inspired and so, my config file is bassicly a copy of the one used in the video. 
  
But it`s not a 100% copy. Yes, all  collors and also the bar and fonts and the same, but that`s because I like them. But what I have changed is resolution of rofi(I will get to this later) to fit my 1366*786 screen. 
  
If you wantto use my i3config,I recommend you to do some things first.
   Firstly, download fonts from .fonts directory.And install them. How todo that, just read provided readme file in .fonts directory.
   Then You would need to download 3rd party software. Speciallz rofi,compton and i3blocks.Most of distros got this softwarein their repos.
       Rofi is used instead of D-menu
       Compton enables opacity on windows
       i3 blocks is used for status on bar


Then when you have downloaded and installed all of this software you can use my config file.
  All you need to do is neplace the old config file with the new one.Afer that just log out/in.
